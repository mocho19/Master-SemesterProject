# Master-SemesterProject
For the purpose of achieving universal health coverage with the goal of providing equitable access to all people regardless of their financial circumstances. Many of the issues discussed in the introduction have been considered while working on this project to achieve universal health coverage through the digitalization of the healthcare management system. Electronic health records play a critical role in the digital health care system in terms of storing, communicating, and passing medical records to other parties involved in health care delivery. Bangladesh’s constitution declares that states have fundamental responsibilities to provide for their citizens’ basic needs, such as food, clothing, shelter, education, and medical care. [IGS 2012] Addressing these issues and focusing on the factors that significantly influenced physician adoption of electronic health record systems will be a significant focus of this project. By establishing a direct link between individuals and doctors, it will be possible to demonstrate how the services meet the SDG’s goal of ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all people of all ages, which is critical for long-term development. As part of my Green ICT course, the project also aims to demonstrate how the proposed service meets the three pillars of sustainability: social equity, economic viability, and environmental protection. The proposal will also discuss the strategy’s importance and how it will provide a common platform for the country to address existing digital health challenges like interoperability, cross-border data security, and proper data use.
